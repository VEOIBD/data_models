# sequencing_saturation
Fraction of reads originating from an already-observed UMI. Is a function of library complexity and sequencing depth calculated as the ratio of the number of confidently-mapped reads with a valid cell-barcode and valid UMI divided by the subset of those reads that had a non-unique combination of cell-barcode, UMI, gene.
